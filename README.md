## Machine Learning Analyses Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Analyses Repository! This repository contains in-depth reports and analysis for three distinct machine learning projects. Each project tackles a unique dataset and problem statement, offering comprehensive insights into the methodologies, findings, and implications.

### Titanic Survival Prediction

**Dataset:** Titanic dataset

**Objective:** Classification of survival outcome on the Titanic dataset.

**Description:** This analysis delves into the infamous Titanic dataset, aiming to predict the survival of passengers based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. The report provides detailed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering techniques, and several classification algorithms comparison, highlighting the model's performance and insights gained from the analysis.

### Thyroid Cancer Classification

**Dataset:** Thyroid dataset

**Objective:** Classification of thyroid cancer using machine learning techniques.

**Description:** This analysis focuses on the classification of thyroid cancer using a specialized dataset. It explores different features related to thyroid health and employs various classification algorithms to predict the presence or absence of thyroid cancer. The report details preprocessing steps, model selection, evaluation metrics, and insights gained from the analysis.

### Racial Profiling in Law Enforcement

**Dataset:** Chicago Arrest Dataset

**Objective:** Data classification to identify racial profiling trends in law enforcement.

**Description:** This analysis investigates the presence of racial profiling in law enforcement using the Chicago Arrest dataset. Through detailed exploratory data analysis and classification techniques, the report examines patterns of arrests across different racial demographics. It sheds light on potential biases and implications for law enforcement practices, aiming to contribute to discussions surrounding fair and just policing.

Each of these analyses provides a comprehensive understanding of the datasets and the machine learning methodologies employed, making them valuable resources for researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts alike. Check out the respective folders for detailed reports and code implementations.
